Dr. Torsten John is a Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, where his work is focused on the design and theory of peptide- and DNA-based self-assembled bionanomaterials. He received his doctoral degree in chemistry with _summa cum laude_ distinction from Leipzig University, where he studied peptide aggregation near nanoparticle and membrane surfaces. Dr. John has international research experience working in the US and Australia, including positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Monash University and the University of Queensland. He has received numerous awards and honors for his research contributions, including recognition as a CAS/SciFinder Future Leader, an Endeavour Research Fellow, and a member of the IUPAC Periodic Table of Younger Chemists. He was also selected as a Young Scientist at the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings. Dr. John's postdoctoral research is supported by a Feodor Lynen Fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and he is the immediate Past Chair and Advisor of the International Younger Chemists Network (IYCN), working to promote the professional development of early-career chemists and strengthen the international scientific community. He is dedicated to mentoring the next generation of scientists and engineers.

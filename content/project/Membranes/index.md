title: Drug- and Peptide-Membrane Interactions
summary: This research focuses on understanding membrane interactions essential for biomolecular transport in cellular environments. Specifically, I investigate antimicrobial and amyloidogenic peptides, their membrane pore-forming abilities, and the impact of surface properties on peptide adsorption. My research employs both experimental and computational techniques to study these fundamental processes.
